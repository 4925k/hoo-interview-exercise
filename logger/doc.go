package logger

/*
	this package was created in order to fulfill a few requirements from my interviewer

	the interviewer want a logger that could:
		- log to multiple destination
			- logger logs to file, udp port and a mocked aws cloud storage
		- support for multiple users
			- logger can be initiliazed by passing a  path to the config file
			- different users can give different paths and use the logger
		- limit same logs
			- logger checks for previous logs and skips logging if
			   the same message has been logged for n times where n is currently 10.

	NOTES
	error handling has been omited in a few places.
	aws cloud storage logging is mocked

	FURTHER WORK
	make a io.MultiWriter for a default logger? helps if the number of locations increase a lot
